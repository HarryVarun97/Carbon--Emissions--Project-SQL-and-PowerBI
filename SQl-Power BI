-- First, I look over my dataset

-- then, I check if there are any columns that have null values.

-- after making sure that there are no nulls in my dataset, I move to exam the smaller parts of my dataset
-- including the range of the column "Year", distinct value of the column "Series", the range of the column "Value" 
-- with different conditions.

-- after checking some smaller parts of my dataset, I find out that the 'Series' column has 2 distinct values.
-- I decide to break these two values into two different tables so that I can work with them easier. 

-- firstly, I creat a new table called 'emissions'

CREATE TABLE emissions (

    Series NVARCHAR(100),
    value FLOAT
);

-- I insert values from the 'Carbon_Emission' table where Series = 'Emissions (thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide)'
-- into the 'emissions' table that I just create.

insert into emissions
select * from weekday_7pm.`carbon dioxide emission estimates`
where Series = 'Emissions (thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide)';

SELECT 
    *

-- Next, I creat a new table called 'perCapital' for the series Emissions per capita (metric tons of carbon dioxide)

CREATE TABLE perCaptial1 (

    Series NVARCHAR(100),
    Value FLOAT

-- I insert values from the 'Carbon_Emission' table where Series = 'Emissions per capita (metric tons of carbon dioxide)'
-- into the 'perCapital' table that I just create

insert into perCaptial1
select * from weekday_7pm.`carbon dioxide emission estimates`

-- Now, I'm going to explore the perCapital table first 

select * from perCaptial1;

 -- next, I find the min and max value of Carbon Emissions per capital in America

-- now, I'm going to with the emissions table

-- So, the max value Year is 2005 and min value Year is 1975.


-- finally, I want to find out which 5 countries have the highest amount of carbon emissions.

SELECT

FROM
    emissions
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY sum_value DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- So, the Top 5 countries having highest amount of carbon emissions are : China,USA,India,Russian Federation,Japan.
